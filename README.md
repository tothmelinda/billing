# Billing Project

The Billing Project is a web application designed for transmitting indexes and issuing invoices for the users signed up. It serves as the frontend for the ElectricityBilling project, which has a Java and Spring Boot backend.

This project is built using React and is aimed at helping to learn new concepts and develop your frontend skills. It serves as my first project in which I am exploring and practising various skills commonly used in React development.

## Key Features

- User sign-up and authentication: Users can sign up for an account and authenticate themselves to access the application.
- Index transmission: Users can transmit their electricity indexes through the application.
- Invoice generation: The application generates invoices based on the transmitted indexes.
- Integration with backend: The frontend communicates with the backend API of the ElectricityBilling project to retrieve and send data.

## Getting Started

To run the Billing Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone the ElectricityBilling project from the repository.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Additional Notes

- This project will evolve over time as the backend application develops and as I continue to enhance my frontend skills.
